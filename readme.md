# Cleaning Data of a cafe sales.

## Input data:

* Here I recieved a data from the billing machine at the previous place.

## Goal:

- To generate a lable for the dataset with respect to the column "Total".
  
  - If the "Total" is below 75₹ then it is considered as 1 or Low.
  
  - If the "Total" is above 76₹ below 150₹ then it is considered as 2 or Medium.
  
  - If the "Total" is above or equal to 150₹ then it is considered as 3 or High.
